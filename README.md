# Desktop Restore Macro

This Webex Device macro monitors restores your desktop local preview once you have answered a call on your device.

## Overview

If you use a Webex Device as a screen normally then either place or receive a call, it will automatically hide any local presentation preview ( your desktop ) which may be showing. This Webex Device macro monitors for this situation and atomatically restores the local presentation preview once the call has been established, enabling you to continue working on your desktop.

## Setup

1. Download the ``desktop-restore.js`` file and upload it to your Webex Desks Macro editor via the web interface.
